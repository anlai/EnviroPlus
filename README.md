This is still a work in progress, but the python code is mostly there.

# Enviro+ Data Collector

This code heavily borrowed from the Pimoroni examples on how to collect and display the data.  It collects data from the suite of environmental sensors when using a Pimoroni Enviro+ and PMS5003.  You can do a couple of things with the information: display it on the screen, push it to InfluxDB, or override the InfluxDB target to your choice of target.

## Required Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Zero WH
- Pimoroni Enviro+ Board
- PMS5003 Particle Sensor

The above components are required just for the software to work, but if you want to make it in a nice case you can check out my [case design here](https://github.com/anlai/EnviroPlus_Case).
